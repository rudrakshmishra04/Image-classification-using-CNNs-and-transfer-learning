A classifier to classify images onto one of three classes(dog, cat, panda) using CNN, VGG16 and ResNet50

Building a Zoo classifier

Build a classifier to classify images onto one of three classes/labels. The dataset  Download datasetconsists of three folders (cats, dogs and panda), containing images in different dimensions. 

Steps followed:

1) Pre-process and explore the dataset

2) Build two classifiers such as.

Classifier 1: Build a model based on a convolutional neural network.

Classifier 2: Build a model from a pretrained model using transfer learning ( VGG 19 and ResNet50).

3) Save the model weights locally after training and load them to classify an unforeseen image.
